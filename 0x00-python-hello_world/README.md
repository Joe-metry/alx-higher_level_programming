BRIEF PREVIEW OF WHAT A SHELL SCRIPT THAT RUNS A PYTHON SCRIPT IS:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A shell script that runs a Python script is a program that executes a
Python script using a Unix/Linux shell interpreter. This type of shell
script typically contains one or more commands that specify the name
and location of the Python script file to be executed, as well as any
arguments or options that need to be passed to the Python interpreter.
Here's an example of a simple shell script that runs a Python script:


#!/bin/bash
python /path/to/my_script.py arg1 arg2

In this example, the first line #!/bin/bash tells the shell which
interpreter to use to execute the script (in this case, bash). The
second line python /path/to/my_script.py arg1 arg2 runs the Python
interpreter and passes the path to the Python script file
/path/to/my_script.py as well as two arguments arg1 and arg2.
This type of shell script is commonly used to automate repetitive
tasks or to run Python scripts as part of a larger workflow or system.
It can also be used to set up and configure Python environments,
install Python packages, and more.
