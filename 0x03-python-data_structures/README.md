A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF WHAT LISTS AND TUPLES DATA STRUCTURES ARE IN PYTHON:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------	

In Python, lists and tuples are two commonly used data structures
for storing and organizing data.

A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data
type such as integers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable,
which means you can add, remove, or modify items in a list after it
has been created. Lists are denoted using square brackets "[]" and
items are separated by commas.

For example, to create a list of numbers, you could write:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

============================================================================
A tuple, on the other hand, is also an ordered collection of items,
but it is immutable, which means you cannot add, remove, or modify
items once it has been created. Tuples are often used to represent
fixed collections of related data, such as the coordinates of a point
in space. Tuples are denoted using parentheses "()" and items are
separated by commas.

For example, to create a tuple of coordinates, you could write:

coordinates = (3.14, 2.71, 0)

Both lists and tuples are useful data structures in Python, and
choosing which one to use depends on the specific use case and
requirements of your program.
