More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary:
-----------------------------------------------
Set:


A set is a collection of unique elements, which means
that each element can only appear once in the set.
You can create a set in Python by enclosing a
comma-separated list of elements in curly braces, like this:

	my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


You can also create a set using the set()
function and passing in a list of elements:

	my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

Dictionaries:

A dictionary, on the other hand, is a collection
of key-value pairs. You can think of a dictionary
like a real-world dictionary, where you look up a 
word (the key) to find its definition (the value).
In Python, you can create a dictionary by enclosing
a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly
braces, like this:

	my_dict = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}

You can also create a dictionary using the dict()
function and passing in a list of key-value tuples:

	my_dict = dict([('apple', 3), ('banana', 2), ('orange', 1)])
