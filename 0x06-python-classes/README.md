an Overview of Classes and Objects in Python:
---------------------------------------------

Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports
the creation and manipulation of objects, which are instances of classes.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and
methods that the objects will have. An attribute is a piece of data associated
with an object, and a method is a function that operates on that data.

To create a new object from a class, you can use the class name followed by
parentheses, like this:

my_object = MyClass().

This creates a new object of type MyClass.
=================================================================================
Once you have created an object, you can access its attributes and methods using
dot notation. For example, if my_object has an attribute called name, you can
access it like this:

my_object.name.
=================================================================================
You can define your own classes in Python using the class keyword. Here is an
example of a simple class definition:


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
=================================================================================
In this example, Person is a class that represents a person. It has two attributes,
name and age, and one method, say_hello, which prints a greeting.
The __init__ method is a special method that is called when a new object is
created from the class. It initializes the object's attributes.

To create a new Person object, you would call the class constructor and pass in
values for the name and age attributes, like this:


person1 = Person("Alice", 25)

You can then call the say_hello method on the person1 object:

bash

person1.say_hello() 

# Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

Overall, classes and objects provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate data
in Python, making it a popular choice for object-oriented programming.
