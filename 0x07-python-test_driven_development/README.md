UnitTests in Python and Test Driven Development:
--------------------------------------------------------

Unit tests are a type of automated testing in software
development that verify the functionality of small,
isolated parts (units) of code. In Python, unit tests
are typically written using a framework such as pytest
or unittest. The goal of unit testing is to ensure that
each individual unit of code behaves as expected, and
that changes to the code don't introduce unintended bugs.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a development process
in which unit tests are written before the code itself.
The process typically involves the following steps:

Write a failing unit test that specifies the behavior
you want to implement.
Write the simplest code that will make the test pass.
Refactor the code to remove duplication or improve
readability, while ensuring that all tests still pass.
The TDD process can help ensure that code is thoroughly
tested and that it meets the requirements specified by
the tests. It can also help catch bugs early in the
development process, when they are easier and cheaper
to fix.
