More on Classes and Objects:
------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate
data and the functions that operate on that data. An object is an
instance of a class, and it can hold its own data and functions.

Here's an example of a simple class definition in Python:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} ({self.year})"
============================================================================

In this example, we define a class called Car that has three instance
variables (make, model, and year) and one instance method (get_info())
that returns a formatted string with the car's make, model, and year.

To create an object of this class, we use the class name as a function
and pass in the arguments required by the constructor (the __init__ method):

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022)
============================================================================

In this example, we create an instance of the Car class and assign it to
the variable my_car. We pass in the required arguments to the constructor
to set the make, model, and year instance variables.


We can now access the instance variables and methods of this object using
the dot notation:

print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.get_info())  # Output: Toyota Camry (2022)
============================================================================

In this example, we print the make instance variable of my_car and call the
get_info() method to get the formatted string.

In summary, classes and objects are a fundamental aspect of object-oriented
programming in Python. Classes define the structure of objects, while objects
are instances of classes that hold their own data and functions.
By using classes and objects, you can write more organized, modular,
and reusable code in Python.
