A brief overview of what Everything is aan object implies in Python Programming:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Python, the fundamental concept is that everything
is an object. This means that every data type, such as
numbers, strings, functions, and even modules, are
considered as objects. As objects, they have unique
attributes and methods associated with them. This
design allows for a more consistent and flexible
approach to coding, and makes it easier to write
reusable and modular code.

In Python, the concept of "Everything is an object"
means that every value in Python is an instance of a
specific class, including numbers, strings, functions,
and even modules. This approach to programming treats
everything as an object with its own unique attributes
and methods, allowing for greater flexibility and
consistency in code. For example, you can manipulate
a string using methods such as upper() or lower(), and
you can also define your own methods for custom objects.
This concept is a key feature of Python's object-oriented 
programming paradigm.
