An overview of args and kwargs/JSON encoder and decoder/unittest module/Python test cheatsheet:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. *args and **kwargs:
----------------------
*args and **kwargs are special syntax used in Python to pass a variable number of arguments to
a function.
*args is used to pass a variable-length list of non-keyworded arguments to a function.
**kwargs is used to pass a variable-length dictionary of keyworded arguments to a function.
These keywords are very useful when you don't know beforehand how many arguments will be passed
to a function.

2. JSON encoder and decoder:
----------------------------

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans
to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Python's JSON module provides
functions to encode and decode JSON data. The json.dumps() function is used to convert a Python
object into a JSON formatted string, while json.loads() function is used to parse a JSON formatted
string into a Python object.

3. Unittest module:
-------------------

The unittest module is a built-in testing framework in Python that allows you to write and run tests
for your code. It provides a set of classes and methods to create test cases and execute them.
Unittest is widely used to write automated tests for Python projects.

4. Python test cheatsheet:
--------------------------

A Python test cheatsheet is a quick reference guide that contains important syntax and concepts
related to Python testing frameworks such as unittest, pytest, doctest, and others. It contains
examples of how to create test cases, run tests, and write assertions. The cheatsheet is useful
for developers who want to quickly write and run tests for their Python projects.
