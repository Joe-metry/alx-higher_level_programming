PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, subqueries, JOIN and UNION:
-----------------------------------------------------

PRIMARY KEY: It is a column or a set of columns in a database table
that uniquely identifies each row. It ensures the uniqueness and
integrity of the data in the table.

FOREIGN KEY: It is a column or a set of columns in a database table
that establishes a link or relationship between two tables.
It refers to the primary key of another table, creating a
relationship between them.

SUBQUERIES: Subqueries are queries embedded within another query.
They are used to retrieve data from one table based on the results
of another query. The output of the subquery is used as input for
the outer query.

JOIN: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on
a related column between them. It allows you to retrieve data that
is spread across multiple tables by matching the values in the
related columns.

UNION: UNION is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT
statements into a single result set. It is used when you want to
merge rows from different tables or queries into one result set,
eliminating duplicates.
