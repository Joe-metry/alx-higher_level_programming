Overview of Task:
-----------------

Python - Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational
database using Python objects and methods instead of writing SQL queries directly.
It provides a bridge between the relational database and the object-oriented programming paradigm.

ORM frameworks, such as SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM, enable developers to define Python classes that represent
database tables and define relationships between them. These classes, known as models, encapsulate the logic
for accessing and manipulating the database.

ORM simplifies database operations by abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries, table creation, and
data retrieval.
Developers can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database by manipulating Python
objects, without having to write SQL statements explicitly.

ORM frameworks handle tasks like mapping object attributes to database columns, generating SQL queries, and
managing transactions. They provide a high-level API for querying and manipulating the database, allowing
developers to focus on application logic rather than database intricacies.

By using Python ORM, developers can achieve greater code readability, reusability, and maintainability.
It also promotes database independence, as ORM frameworks can work with various relational database systems
like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.

Overall, Python - Object-Relational Mapping simplifies the process of integrating relational databases into
Python applications, providing an intuitive and efficient way to work with data while leveraging the
benefits of object-oriented programming.
