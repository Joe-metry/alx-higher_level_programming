JavaScript is a popular programming language used for adding interactivity and
dynamic functionality to websites. It can also be used in other environments,

browser, you can include the code in an HTML file using <script> tags.
JavaScript's versatility, wide adoption, and easy-to-learn syntax make it amazing.
It offers a rich set of features and APIs for building interactive user interfaces,
manipulating data, and handling asynchronous operations.
The language has a thriving community, abundant resources, and a vast ecosystem of
libraries and frameworks. JavaScript's ability to run on any device with a browser
makes it a powerful tool for web development.
