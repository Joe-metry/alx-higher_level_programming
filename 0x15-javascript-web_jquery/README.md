A Concise Overview of Project:
------------------------------

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites.
It is supported by all major web browsers and allows developers to manipulate web page elements, handle user
interactions, and manage data on the client-side. JavaScript is also used on the server-side (Node.js)
for backend development.

jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies and enhances the process of interacting with HTML documents
and handling events.
It provides a concise and efficient way to select and manipulate DOM elements, animate content, and perform AJAX
requests to communicate with servers. jQuery simplifies cross-browser compatibility and has been widely adopted in
web development, though its usage has declined in recent years with the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
