This README is on Higher Level Programing on my SoftWare Engineering Journey with ALX.

This level starts with python programming language, and I will be giving some brief note about this programming language.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used for a wide range of tasks such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Python's syntax is easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming, and has a large standard library that provides many useful tools and modules for various tasks. One of the key features of Python is its dynamic typing and automatic memory management, which means that programmers don't have to worry about memory allocation or type declarations. This makes it a very productive language to work with, especially for rapid prototyping and development. Python has a vast and active community of users, developers, and contributors, who have created numerous third-party libraries and frameworks that make it even more powerful and versatile. Some of the most popular Python frameworks include Django, Flask, and Pyramid for web development, and NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy for scientific computing and data analysis.
